# Weather

Weather is a site that gets the weather of a location query.

## Description

Weather uses the ReactJS library, [tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com/) framework and the [framer motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) library. It also uses
the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/) as well as the [LocationIQ API](https://locationiq.com/). The site is as simple as a weather application
can be with weather prediction in the next 24 hours.
